### üîÑ **Confirmed Workflow Architecture**

```
User ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Backlog ‚Üí Prime Risk Assessment ‚Üí User Confirmation ‚Üí Story ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Dev Agents ‚Üí QA Agents ‚Üí Defects ‚Üí Prime Commit
```

#### **Table Hierarchy**
1. **Backlog** ‚Üí User story input with success criteria
2. **Story** ‚Üí Prime-approved work from backlog  
3. **Task** ‚Üí Sequential work units from stories
4. **Defect** ‚Üí QA-discovered issues requiring resolution

#### **Prime's Operational Logic**
- **When Queue Empty**: Analyzes backlog, recommends high-value/low-risk stories
- **When Active**: Focuses entirely on completing active work with sequential task assignment
- **Zero Tolerance**: QA agents create defects for ANY mocks or shortcuts found
- **Clean Commits**: Only after complete validation, testing, and defect resolution

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety & Quality Systems**

#### **Git Tree Isolation**
- `feature/story-{id}-dev` - Development work
- `feature/story-{id}-qa` - QA testing
- `feature/story-{id}-ready` - Prime merge preparation
- **Sequential Integration** prevents all merge conflicts

#### **QA Agent Integration**
- **Serena Code Analysis** - Symbol-level quality checking
- **Playwright Functional Testing** - Automated user workflow validation
- **Mock Detection** - Zero tolerance for shortcuts or placeholders
- **Success Criteria Validation** - Against original backlog requirements

#### **Prime Commit Standards**
- **Conventional Commits** - Professional semantic commit messages
- **Complete Validation** - All tasks completed, QA passed, defects resolved
- **Risk Analysis** - Pre-commit safety assessment and conflict detection
- **Clean History** - Logical, well-documented commit progression

### üìä **Real-Time Dashboard Features**

#### **Live Metrics**
- Active Stories, Backlog Items, Queue Tasks, Development Tasks, Completed Tasks
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds with visual indicators

#### **Interactive Kanban**
- **Queue**: Tasks awaiting agent assignment with sequence ordering
- **Development**: Active tasks with agent type and current action
- **QA**: Tasks under validation with results and findings
- **Done**: Completed tasks with success criteria verification

#### **Backlog Management**
- **Story Creation Form** with title, description, success criteria, priority, business value
- **Prime Recommendations** with risk analysis and logical reasoning
- **Risk Scoring** with historical landmine pattern matching
