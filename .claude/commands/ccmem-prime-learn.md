```

## Example Learning Session

```bash
# 1. Teach Prime about the dashboard
/ccmem-prime-learn kanban-dashboard.md

# 2. Prime learns the facts and responds
‚úÖ Prime learned 15 facts from kanban-dashboard.md

üìö Categories learned: dashboard, kanban, commands

üí° Sample facts:
‚Ä¢ Refresh Command: ./refresh_dashboard.sh to update data and open browser
‚Ä¢ Queue Column: Contains pending tasks waiting to start development
‚Ä¢ Data Export: python3 ccmem_export.py generates JSONP data file...

# 3. Prime can now answer dashboard questions
/ccmem-prime "What's in the Done column?"

# Prime responds with learned knowledge:
üß† Based on my learned knowledge about the kanban dashboard, the Done column contains completed tasks that have been finished successfully...
