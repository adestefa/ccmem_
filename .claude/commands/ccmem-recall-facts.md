```

## Integration with Prime

Recalled facts enhance Prime's responses:

```bash
# Check what Prime knows about dashboards
/ccmem-recall-facts dashboard

# Prime can then use this knowledge  
/ccmem-prime "Based on what you know about our dashboard, what should I do to see current progress?"

# Prime references learned facts:
ðŸ§  Based on my learned knowledge about the dashboard, you should run ./refresh_dashboard.sh 
to update the kanban board data and open it in your browser. This will show you the current 
progress with visual progress bars and task distribution across Queue â†’ Development â†’ QA â†’ Done columns.
```
