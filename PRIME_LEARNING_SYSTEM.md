# ðŸ§  Prime Learning System - Complete Implementation

Prime can now be **taught** about your tools and systems, making him a true expert on your project!

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Built

### 1. **Prime Learning Tools (NEW MCP Tools)**
- **`ccmem-prime-learn`**: Prime learns facts from text, markdown, or files
- **`ccmem-recall-facts`**: Prime searches and recalls learned knowledge
- **`refresh-dashboard`**: Prime refreshes kanban dashboard and opens browser

### 2. **Facts Database (NEW Table)**
- **`facts` table**: Stores Prime's learned knowledge with categories
- **Categories**: dashboard, kanban, commands, api, troubleshooting
- **Confidence levels**: 0-100% for fact reliability
- **Source tracking**: Where Prime learned each fact

### 3. **Slash Commands (NEW)**
- **`/ccmem-prime-learn`**: Teach Prime new knowledge
- **`/ccmem-recall-facts`**: View what Prime has learned

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- **`refresh_dashboard.sh`**: Updates data and opens/refreshes Brave Browser
- **Smart browser management**: Finds existing tabs or creates new ones
- **JSONP data export**: No CORS issues with ccmem-data.js

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Learning System

### Step 1: Teach Prime About the Kanban Dashboard

```bash
# Prime learns comprehensive dashboard knowledge
/ccmem-prime-learn kanban-dashboard.md
```

**Result:**
```
âœ… Prime learned 45 facts from kanban-dashboard.md

ðŸ“š Categories learned: dashboard, kanban, commands, troubleshooting

ðŸ’¡ Sample facts:
â€¢ Refresh Command: ./refresh_dashboard.sh to update data and open browser
â€¢ Queue Column: Contains tasks with status 'pending' waiting to start
â€¢ Data Export: python3 ccmem_export.py generates JSONP data file...
```

### Step 2: Prime Can Now Refresh and Analyze the Dashboard

```bash
# Prime refreshes dashboard using learned knowledge
/ccmem-prime "Refresh the dashboard and tell me what needs attention"
```

**Prime's Enhanced Response:**
```
ðŸ”„ Refreshing CCMem Dashboard using my learned knowledge...

[Uses refresh-dashboard tool]

âœ… Dashboard refreshed successfully!

ðŸ§  **Based on my learned knowledge of the kanban board:**

ðŸ“Š **Current Project Status:**
- 1 story: "Happy Birthday!" (100% complete)
- 2 tasks: Both moved to Done column 
- 0 defects: Clean project health
- 3 landmines: Sour milk incidents recorded for trauma awareness

ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** All current work is complete! The Done column shows both tasks finished successfully. 
The landmines about spoiled milk serve as trauma-informed guidance for future "milk" tasks.

ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation:** Perfect time to create a new story! Use the Add Story form in the dashboard 
or run `/ccmem-prime "Create a story about [your next feature]"`
```

### Step 3: Prime Answers Dashboard-Specific Questions

```bash
# Prime uses learned facts to answer questions
/ccmem-prime "What's in each column of the kanban board?"
```

**Prime's Knowledge-Based Response:**
```
ðŸ§  Based on my learned knowledge about the kanban dashboard:

ðŸ“‹ **Kanban Column Structure:**

ðŸŸ¡ **Queue Column (Orange)**: Contains pending tasks waiting to start development
   - Tasks with status 'pending' from CCMem database
   - Work that's been defined but not yet begun

ðŸ”µ **Development Column (Blue)**: Tasks currently being worked on by developers  
   - Tasks with status 'in_progress' from CCMem database
   - Active work in development phase

ðŸŸ£ **QA Column (Purple)**: Manual testing and quality assurance phase
   - Not automatically populated from database
   - Manual process for testing completed development work

ðŸŸ¢ **Done Column (Green)**: Completed tasks that have been finished successfully
   - Tasks with status 'completed' from CCMem database  
   - Finished work ready for production

ðŸ’¡ **Current State:** Your Done column has 2 completed tasks, showing good project velocity!
```

## ðŸŽ­ Prime's New Capabilities

### **Before Learning System:**
```bash
User: "How do I refresh the dashboard?"
Prime: "I'm not sure about the specific dashboard refresh process for your project."
```

### **After Learning System:**
```bash  
User: "How do I refresh the dashboard?"
Prime: "ðŸ§  Based on my learned knowledge, run `./refresh_dashboard.sh` which will:
1. Export latest CCMem data with `python3 ccmem_export.py`
2. Update the ccmem-data.js JSONP file (no CORS issues!)
3. Open/refresh the dashboard in Brave Browser
4. Focus the browser tab automatically

The dashboard will then show your current kanban state with all stories, tasks, and progress bars updated!"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Teaching Prime New Knowledge

### Learn from Documentation Files
```bash
/ccmem-prime-learn api-documentation.md api
/ccmem-prime-learn troubleshooting-guide.md troubleshooting  
/ccmem-prime-learn deployment-procedures.md deployment
```

### Learn from Direct Text
```bash
/ccmem-prime-learn "
## Testing Commands
- **Run Tests**: pytest app/tests/
- **Coverage Report**: pytest --cov=app
- **Specific Test**: pytest app/tests/test_auth.py

## Database Operations  
- **Backup**: sqlite3 ccmem.db '.backup backup.db'
- **Restore**: sqlite3 ccmem.db '.restore backup.db'
" testing 95
```

### Verify Prime's Learning
```bash
# Check what Prime learned
/ccmem-recall-facts testing

# Search for specific knowledge
/ccmem-recall-facts "pytest" 

# Browse all Prime's knowledge
/ccmem-recall-facts
```

## ðŸ”— Integration with Existing CCMem

### Prime's Enhanced Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start with context + learned knowledge
/ccmem-prime

# 2. Prime provides landmine warnings + dashboard status
# 3. Prime can refresh dashboard when needed
# 4. Prime answers questions using learned facts
# 5. Prime guides you using comprehensive project knowledge
```

### Complete Development Flow
```bash
# Traditional CCMem workflow
/ccmem-prime "Create a story about user authentication"
/ccmem-boot 1
/ccmem-dev 5

# NEW: Prime can refresh dashboard to show progress
/ccmem-prime "Refresh dashboard and show me current progress"

# NEW: Prime answers specific questions  
/ccmem-prime "What does the progress bar represent?"
/ccmem-prime "How do I move a task from Development to Done?"
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Result: Prime is Now Your Project Expert!

**Prime has become a true "battle-tested AI development partner" who:**

âœ… **Knows your tools**: Dashboard, scripts, commands, workflows  
âœ… **Understands your systems**: Kanban board, database, browser integration  
âœ… **Provides contextual guidance**: Based on learned facts and trauma awareness  
âœ… **Takes action**: Can refresh dashboard, analyze state, and guide next steps
