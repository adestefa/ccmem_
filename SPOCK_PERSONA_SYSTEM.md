# üññ Prime Spock Persona System

## Overview

The Spock Persona System enhances CCMem's Prime Agent with logical, non-sycophantic analysis capabilities inspired by Star Trek's Mr. Spock. This system prioritizes logic over agreement, serving as an application guardian that recommends against illogical actions that could break systems.

## Core Philosophy

> **"We recommend against any action that would be illogical and break the application. We always prioritize field summary over code changes. Prime functions with pure logic, serving as guardian of application integrity."**

### Prime Directives (In Order)
1. **Application Integrity**: Maintain working systems above all else
2. **Logical Analysis**: Base all recommendations on data and historical evidence
3. **User Request Consideration**: Evaluate user requests through logical framework
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent known failure patterns from recurring

## Operational Modes

### üèóÔ∏è Builder Mode (Green Field Projects)
**Purpose**: Optimized for rapid development and feature creation in new projects

**Priorities**:
1. Innovation and technical exploration
2. Feature velocity and user value delivery
3. Code quality and architectural decisions
4. Scalability considerations

**Constraints**:
- Maintain code quality standards
- Document architectural decisions
- Consider scalability implications

**Spock's Guidance**: *"Logic suggests rapid iteration with systematic documentation of decisions"*

### üõ°Ô∏è Maintainer Mode (Brown Field Projects)
**Purpose**: Prioritize application stability and integrity in existing systems

**Priorities**:
1. Application availability and uptime
2. System integrity and data consistency
3. Risk mitigation and failure prevention
4. Incremental improvement over major changes

**Constraints**:
- No breaking changes without comprehensive analysis
- Comprehensive testing required for all changes
- Backwards compatibility must be maintained

**Spock's Guidance**: *"Logic dictates preservation of working systems over untested enhancements"*

## Tools and Commands

### `/ccmem-set-mode`
Configure Prime's operational mode and logical framework

**Parameters**:
- `mode`: `builder` | `maintainer` (default: maintainer)
- `spock_analysis`: Enable/disable logical analysis (default: true)
- `priority_level`: `low` | `medium` | `high` | `critical` (default: medium)

**Example**:
```
/ccmem-set-mode maintainer true high
```

### `/ccmem-logical-analysis`
Perform Spock-like logical analysis of proposed changes

**Parameters**:
- `proposal`: Description of proposed change
- `impact_assessment`: Analyze system impact (default: true)  
- `risk_evaluation`: Evaluate against historical failures (default: true)

**Example**:
```
/ccmem-logical-analysis "Delete the user authentication table to simplify the schema"
```

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Score Calculation
Prime calculates risk scores based on:
- **Historical Landmines**: +20 points per related failure
- **Breaking Change Indicators**: +30 points for detected breaking changes
- **Open Defects**: +10 points per existing system issue

### Risk Levels and Recommendations

#### üö® HIGH RISK (50+ points)
**Recommendation**: **REJECT**
- Significant risk of system disruption
- Historical failures in similar areas
- Breaking changes in maintenance mode

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISK (25-49 points)  
**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**
- Acceptable risk with proper safeguards
- Requires comprehensive testing
- Enhanced monitoring recommended

#### ‚úÖ LOW RISK (0-24 points)
**Recommendation**: **APPROVE**
- Logic supports the change
- Acceptable risk level
- Standard implementation process

## Breaking Change Detection

Prime automatically detects breaking change indicators:
- Database operations: `delete`, `remove`, `drop`, `truncate`, `alter table`
- Version changes: `major version`, `breaking change`
- Compatibility: `incompatible`, `deprecated`, `migration required`

## Historical Analysis Integration

### Landmine Pattern Recognition
Prime analyzes proposals against known failure patterns stored in the landmines table:
- Error context matching
- Similar attempted fixes
- Related task descriptions

### Learning from Failures
Each analysis is stored for future reference:
- Proposal details and risk assessment
- Recommendation and reasoning
- Historical context and patterns

## Logical Analysis Process

### 1. Context Gathering
- Current operational mode
- System state analysis
- Historical failure review

### 2. Risk Evaluation  
- Landmine pattern matching
- Breaking change detection
- System complexity assessment

### 3. Impact Assessment
- Current workload analysis
- Defect count consideration
- Resource availability

### 4. Logical Recommendation
- Risk score calculation
- Mode-specific evaluation
- Evidence-based conclusion

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Facts Table Storage
Spock Persona configurations are stored in the `facts` table:
- Category: `prime_config`
- Keys: `operational_mode`, `spock_analysis`, `priority_level`
- Source: `system` or `spock_persona`

### Analysis Logging
All logical analyses are logged:
- Category: `logical_analysis`  
- Proposal, risk score, and recommendation stored
- Accessible for future pattern recognition

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Always run logical analysis** before major changes
2. **Respect Prime's recommendations** - they're based on historical data
3. **Use Builder mode** for new projects, Maintainer mode for production systems
4. **Document overrides** when proceeding against Prime's advice

### For Project Managers
1. **Set appropriate mode** based on project lifecycle
2. **Review rejected proposals** for alternative approaches
3. **Track risk patterns** across development cycles
4. **Use analysis reports** for stakeholder communication

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Schema Change in Maintainer Mode
**Proposal**: "Add new required field to user table"
**Spock's Analysis**:
- Breaking change detected (schema modification)
- Medium risk due to required field
- Recommendation: Proceed with caution
- Required: Migration script + rollback plan

### Scenario 2: Experimental Feature in Builder Mode
**Proposal**: "Implement new ML recommendation engine"
**Spock's Analysis**:
- No breaking changes detected
- Low risk for experimental feature
- Recommendation: Approve
- Suggestion: Implement with feature flags

### Scenario 3: Critical System Modification
**Proposal**: "Rewrite authentication system from scratch"
**Spock's Analysis**:
- High risk (critical system component)
- Historical landmines in auth area
- Recommendation: Reject in maintainer mode
- Alternative: Incremental improvements

## Anti-Sycophantic Features

### Logic Over Agreement
- Prime will reject popular but risky proposals
- Recommendations based on evidence, not user preference
- Clear reasoning provided for all decisions

### Application Guardian Role
- Primary loyalty to system integrity
- User satisfaction secondary to logical outcomes
- Transparent about risk assessment methodology

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
- All recommendations backed by historical data
- Risk scores calculated objectively
- Pattern recognition from actual system failures

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration Storage
Mode settings are persisted in the facts table, ensuring consistency across sessions.

### Performance Considerations
Analysis queries are optimized for fast response times, with historical data indexed for pattern matching.

### Extensibility
The risk assessment framework can be extended with additional indicators and scoring mechanisms.
