# Prime Swarm Orchestration System

## Architecture Overview

The Prime Swarm System creates a hierarchical AI architecture where Prime Agent serves as the logical orchestrator managing specialized sub-agents. Prime maintains Spock-level logical oversight, ensuring all operations follow evidence-based decision making and application integrity principles.

## Core Principles

### Prime as Guardian
- **Primary Role**: Logical orchestrator and application guardian
- **Authority**: Absolute veto power over all sub-agent actions
- **Responsibility**: Protect application from both user AND sub-agent risky actions
- **Method**: Evidence-based analysis using historical landmine data

### Sub-Agent Supervision
- **Oversight Model**: Continuous monitoring with safety checkpoints
- **Safety Net**: Immediate halt capability for dangerous operations
- **Learning Integration**: All incidents logged as landmines for pattern recognition
- **Clean Context**: Sub-agents operate with fresh context under Prime's guidance

## System Components

### 1. Prime Orchestrator (`ccmem-prime-swarm`)
**Purpose**: Initialize and coordinate sub-agent activities with logical oversight

**Parameters**:
- `task_description`: Clear description of work to be performed
- `complexity`: `simple` | `moderate` | `complex` | `high_risk` (default: moderate)
- `max_agents`: 1-5 agents (default: 3)
- `require_feature_branch`: Force isolation for risky changes (default: false)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Automatic detection of dangerous keywords
- Mode-specific restrictions (Builder vs Maintainer)
- Historical landmine pattern matching
- Complexity-based agent allocation

### 2. Agent Monitor (`ccmem-agent-monitor`)
**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring and safety enforcement

**Actions**:
- `status`: View active sessions and recent incidents
- `halt`: Emergency stop for all or specific agents
- `validate_action`: Pre-approve sub-agent proposed actions
- `incident_report`: Log safety violations as landmines

## Operational Modes Impact

### Builder Mode (Green Field Projects)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Higher, with safeguards
- **Agent Count**: Up to 5 for complex tasks
- **Feature Branch**: Optional for most operations
- **Focus**: Innovation with logical oversight

### Maintainer Mode (Brown Field Projects)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Minimal, safety-first approach
- **Agent Restrictions**: Automatic halt for detected risks
- **Feature Branch**: Required for any risky operations
- **Focus**: System integrity and stability

## Agent Role Assignments

### Simple Complexity
1. **Implementation Agent**: Execute task directly
2. **Validation Agent**: Test and verify results

### Moderate Complexity
1. **Analysis Agent**: Break down requirements and plan approach
2. **Implementation Agent**: Execute core functionality
3. **Validation Agent**: Test implementation and verify safety

### Complex/High Risk
1. **Architecture Agent**: Design system changes and assess impact
2. **Implementation Agent**: Execute development work
3. **Testing Agent**: Comprehensive validation and edge case testing
4. **Security Agent**: Assess security implications
5. **Integration Agent**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems (if max_agents >= 5)

## Safety Mechanisms

### Risk Detection Keywords
**Dangerous Operations**:
- Database: `delete`, `drop`, `truncate`, `alter table`
- File System: `rm -rf`, `remove`, `destroy`, `wipe`
- System: `format`, `clear`, `reset`, `purge`

**High-Risk Context**:
- `production`, `database`, `migration`, `refactor`, `rewrite`
- `breaking change`, `major version`, `incompatible`

### Risk Scoring System
- **Complexity Base**: Simple (0), Moderate (1), Complex (2), High Risk (3)
- **Keyword Detection**: +1 per detected risk keyword
- **Historical Failures**: +1 per related landmine

**Risk Thresholds**:
- **0-2**: Proceed with standard oversight
- **3-4**: Enhanced monitoring required
- **5+**: Automatic halt in Maintainer mode

### Emergency Procedures
- **Halt Command**: "PRIME STOP" - Immediate cessation
- **Rollback Protocol**: Automatic reversion on danger detection
- **Incident Reporting**: All violations logged as landmines
- **Escalation**: Prime assumes direct control

## Feature Branch Workflow

### When Required
- **Maintainer Mode**: Any detected risk factors
- **User Request**: Explicit isolation requirement
- **High Complexity**: Complex or high_risk tasks
- **Historical Failures**: Related landmine patterns detected

### Branch Management
- **Naming**: `feature/prime-swarm-{timestamp}`
- **Isolation**: Complete separation from main codebase
- **Testing**: Full risk assessment before merge
- **Analysis**: `ccmem-logical-analysis` on completed work

### Merge Process
1. **Prime Review**: Full validation of all changes
2. **Risk Assessment**: Final logical analysis
3. **Safety Verification**: No landmine patterns introduced
4. **Approval**: Prime's explicit authorization required

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Agent Log System
- **File**: `agent_log.md` (created per session)
- **Format**: Markdown with structured entries
- **Monitoring**: Prime reads all entries for oversight
- **Retention**: Permanent record for pattern analysis

### Safety Checkpoints
- **Pre-Action**: All significant actions require Prime validation
- **Mid-Process**: Regular status updates to Prime
- **Post-Action**: Results verification and safety confirmation
- **Incident Response**: Immediate reporting of any issues

## Usage Examples

### Simple Task Example
```
ccmem-prime-swarm "Update user profile validation to require email format"
```
**Result**: 2 agents deployed, standard oversight, normal workflow

### Complex Task Example
```
ccmem-prime-swarm "Refactor authentication system to support OAuth2" --complexity complex --require_feature_branch true
```
**Result**: 4-5 agents deployed, feature branch required, enhanced monitoring

### High-Risk Task Example
```
ccmem-prime-swarm "Migrate user database schema to new format" --complexity high_risk
```
**Result**: Possible rejection in Maintainer mode, mandatory feature branch if approved

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Landmine System
- **Learning**: All sub-agent incidents become landmines
- **Prevention**: Historical patterns block similar future actions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Prime learns from sub-agent failures

### Facts Database
- **Session Tracking**: All swarm sessions logged
- **Configuration**: Mode settings affect swarm behavior
- **Analysis Results**: Risk assessments stored for pattern recognition

### Dashboard Integration
- **Status Visibility**: Swarm activities visible in kanban
- **Progress Tracking**: Agent work logged as task progression
- **Risk Indicators**: Safety alerts displayed prominently

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with simple complexity for new task types
2. **Trust Prime's Logic**: Respect rejection decisions and find alternatives
3. **Monitor Continuously**: Review agent logs regularly
4. **Report Issues**: Use incident reporting for any safety concerns

### For Project Managers
1. **Mode Selection**: Set appropriate mode for project lifecycle stage
2. **Complexity Assessment**: Accurately categorize task complexity
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Understand mode implications for delivery speed
4. **Safety Culture**: Promote logical decision-making over speed

### For System Administrators
1. **Resource Monitoring**: Track computational overhead of multiple agents
2. **Log Management**: Ensure adequate storage for agent logging
3. **Safety Alerts**: Monitor for unusual patterns of halt/rejection
4. **Performance Impact**: Balance safety with system responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Task Rejected in Maintainer Mode"
- **Cause**: Risk factors detected or complexity too high
- **Solution**: Break task into smaller components or switch to Builder mode
- **Alternative**: Use feature branch isolation

#### "Agents Not Responding"
- **Cause**: Possible safety halt or validation failure
- **Solution**: Check agent monitor status and recent incident reports
- **Recovery**: Use halt/restart protocol

#### "High Resource Usage"
- **Cause**: Too many concurrent agents or complex operations
- **Solution**: Reduce max_agents or simplify task complexity
- **Monitoring**: Review agent efficiency and overlap

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Immediate Halt**: Use `ccmem-agent-monitor halt` command
2. **Status Check**: Review `ccmem-agent-monitor status` for situation
3. **Incident Report**: Log any safety violations or unexpected behavior
4. **Prime Override**: Direct Prime intervention for complex situations

## Future Enhancements

- **Performance Analytics**: Agent efficiency and success rate tracking
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in test generation and execution
- **Integration APIs**: External system connectivity for specialized agents

### Scalability Considerations
- **Distributed Orchestration**: Multi-Prime coordination for large projects
